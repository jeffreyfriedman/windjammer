**Outcome**: Battle-tested, polished, production-validated Windjammer

---

### 🔮 v0.24.0 - Planned (6-8 weeks)

**Theme**: Advanced Optimizations (Phases 10-15)

**Goal**: Push performance even further with expert-level optimizations

#### New Optimization Phases

**Phase 10: Arc/Rc Optimization**
- Detect shared ownership patterns
- Automatically use `Arc` for thread-safe sharing
- Use `Rc` for single-threaded scenarios
- **Impact**: Safer concurrent code, automatic

**Phase 11: Iterator Fusion**
- Combine chained iterator operations
- Eliminate intermediate allocations
- **Impact**: 2-5x faster for iterator chains
- **Example**: `.filter().map().collect()` → single pass

**Phase 12: Bounds Check Elimination**
- Prove array access is safe at compile time
- Use `get_unchecked` where provably safe
- **Impact**: 10-20% faster tight loops

**Phase 13: SIMD Auto-vectorization**
- Detect vectorizable loops
- Generate SIMD instructions automatically
- **Impact**: 4-8x faster for data processing
- **Example**: Array operations, image processing

**Phase 14: Async Optimization**
- Detect unnecessary `.await` points
- Optimize future combinators
- Reduce async overhead
- **Impact**: Lower latency, higher throughput

**Phase 15: Memory Layout Optimization**
- Reorder struct fields for better packing
- Align hot fields to cache lines
- **Impact**: Better cache utilization

#### Validation

**Use Production Apps**:
- Validate optimizations with TaskFlow (Phase 10, 11, 14)
- Validate with CLI tool (Phase 11, 12, 13)
- Validate with WebSocket server (Phase 10, 14)

**Benchmarks**:
- Comprehensive benchmark suite for each phase
- Real-world performance validation
- Regression testing

**Outcome**: Windjammer generates code that rivals hand-optimized Rust
