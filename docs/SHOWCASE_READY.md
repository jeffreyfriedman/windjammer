## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Server is Running

The server should already be running. If not:

```bash
cd /home/user/src/windjammer/crates/windjammer-ui
cargo run --release --bin serve_wasm
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Windjammer WASM Dev Server
📁 Root: crates/windjammer-ui

- ✅ Professional dark theme (VS Code colors)
- ✅ Status badges showing "Live" and "Demo"

#### Actions to Test:
1. **Click between tabs** - Should smoothly transition with fade animation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Page shows "Not Found"

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/examples/components.css | head -10
```
Should return CSS content, not "Not Found"

### Issue: WASM not loading
**Check browser console**: Should see "✅ Windjammer WASM loaded successfully!"

### Issue: Buttons not clickable
**Check**: 
- Console for JavaScript errors
- WASM is loaded (see above)
- Event handlers are bound (should see console output on click)
