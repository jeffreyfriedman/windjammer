# Windjammer UI Framework - Current Status

## 🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED!

**Pure Windjammer UI code is now running in the browser!**

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Complete Compilation Pipeline ✅
- **Windjammer → Rust → WASM** compilation works end-to-end
- `@export` decorator generates proper `#[wasm_bindgen]` with `pub` visibility
- Signal cloning works correctly in generated code
- All UI components compile successfully

### 2. Reactive State Management ✅
- `Signal<T>` is fully functional
- `#[derive(Clone)]` allows sharing across closures
- Internal `Rc<RefCell<T>>` provides shared mutable state
- Signals can be cloned and used in multiple event handlers

### 3. UI Rendering ✅
- All components render correctly in the browser
- Layout system works (Flex, Container, Panel)
- Styling is applied (VS Code-inspired dark theme)
- Components are composable via `ToVNode` trait

### 4. Event Handlers ✅
- Buttons can be clicked
- Event handlers execute successfully
- Closures capture and modify signals
- Console logging works from WASM

## 🔄 What's Partially Working

### Event-Driven Updates ⚠️
- **Status**: Event handlers execute, signals update, but UI doesn't re-render
- **Example**: Click button → signal changes → console shows new value → UI stays the same
- **Why**: No reactive re-rendering system yet

## ❌ What's Not Working Yet

### 1. Reactive Re-rendering ❌
**Problem**: UI doesn't update when signals change

**Current Behavior**:
```windjammer
let count = Signal::new(0)
Text::new(format!("Count: {}", count.get()))  // Shows "Count: 0"

// Button click:
count.set(5)  // Signal updates ✅
// UI still shows "Count: 0" ❌
```

**What's Needed**:
- Track which VNodes depend on which Signals
- Re-render VNodes when their signals change
- Diff and patch the DOM efficiently

### 2. Virtual DOM Diffing ❌
**Problem**: No way to update the DOM without full re-render

**What's Needed**:
- Implement `diff(old_vnode, new_vnode) -> Vec<Patch>`
- Apply patches to DOM elements
- Handle keyed lists for efficient updates

### 3. Component Lifecycle ❌
**Problem**: No hooks for mount/update/unmount

**What's Needed**:
- `onCreate()` - Component initialization
- `onMount()` - After DOM insertion
- `onUpdate()` - When props/state change
- `onDestroy()` - Cleanup

## 🧪 Live Demo

**URL**: http://localhost:8080/examples/button_test.html

**What to Test**:
1. Open the URL in your browser
2. Open DevTools console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Click the "Click Me!" button
4. Watch the console - you'll see:
   ```
   🎉 Button clicked! Count: 1
   🎉 Button clicked! Count: 2
   🎉 Button clicked! Count: 3
   ```
5. The UI won't update (yet), but the signal does!

**This proves**:
- ✅ WASM loads and runs
- ✅ UI renders correctly
- ✅ Buttons are clickable
- ✅ Event handlers execute
- ✅ Signals update
- ✅ Console logging works

## 📊 Architecture

### Current Flow
```
Windjammer Code
    ↓
Signal::new(0)  ← Creates reactive state ✅
    ↓
Button::on_click(|| count.set(...))  ← Event handler ✅
    ↓
User clicks button  ← DOM event ✅
    ↓
count.set(5)  ← Updates Signal value ✅
    ↓
console.log(...)  ← Logs to console ✅
    ↓
??? ← Missing: Trigger re-render ❌
    ↓
Update DOM ← Doesn't happen ❌
```

### Needed Flow
```
Signal::set(value)
    ↓
Notify subscribers
    ↓
Mark dependent VNodes as dirty
    ↓
Schedule re-render
    ↓
Diff old vs new VNode
    ↓
Generate patches
    ↓
Apply patches to DOM
    ↓
UI updates! ✅
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Manual Re-rendering (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Get the counter working with manual `App::re_render()` calls

```windjammer
Button::new("Increment")
    .on_click(move || {
        count.set(count.get() + 1)
        App::re_render()  // Manually trigger
    })
```

**Tasks**:
1. Store root VNode in global state
2. Implement `App::re_render()` method
3. Clear and re-render entire app
4. Test with counter example

**Pros**: Simple, works immediately
**Cons**: Inefficient (full re-render), manual

### Phase 2: Automatic Effect-Based Reactivity (4-6 hours)
**Goal**: Auto-update UI when signals change (Solid.js style)

```rust
// In Signal::set()
pub fn set(&self, value: T) {
    self.value.replace(value);
    // Notify all subscribers
    for effect_id in self.subscribers.borrow().iter() {
        EFFECT_REGISTRY.run_effect(effect_id);
    }
}
```

**Tasks**:
1. Implement `Effect` system
2. Track Signal reads in effects
3. Auto-run effects when Signals change
4. Wrap event handlers in effects

**Pros**: Automatic, elegant
**Cons**: More complex, requires effect system

### Phase 3: Virtual DOM Diffing (6-8 hours)
**Goal**: Efficient partial DOM updates

```rust
fn diff(old: &VNode, new: &VNode) -> Vec<Patch> {
    match (old, new) {
        (VNode::Text(old_text), VNode::Text(new_text)) => {
            if old_text != new_text {
                vec![Patch::SetText(new_text.clone())]
            } else {
                vec![]
            }
        }
        // ... handle elements, attributes, children
    }
}
```

**Tasks**:
1. Implement diffing algorithm
2. Generate minimal patches
3. Apply patches efficiently
4. Handle keyed lists

**Pros**: Maximum performance
**Cons**: Complex, takes time

### Phase 4: Component System (8-10 hours)
**Goal**: React-like components with props and lifecycle

```windjammer
struct CounterProps {
    initial: i32,
}

fn Counter(props: CounterProps) -> Container {
    let count = use_signal(props.initial)
    
    Container::new()
        .child(Text::new(format!("Count: {}", count.get())))
        .child(Button::new("Increment")
            .on_click(move || count.set(count.get() + 1)))
}
```

**Tasks**:
1. Define Component trait
2. Implement lifecycle hooks
3. Add props system
4. Support composition

**Pros**: Full React-like experience
**Cons**: Most complex, longest time

**Excitement**: 🚀🚀🚀

## 📝 Testing Instructions

1. **Start the server** (already running):
   ```bash
   cd /home/user/src/windjammer/crates/windjammer-ui
   cargo run --bin serve_wasm
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   http://localhost:8080/examples/button_test.html

3. **Open DevTools console**:
   - Chrome/Edge: F12 or Cmd+Option+I
   - Firefox: F12 or Cmd+Option+K
   - Safari: Cmd+Option+C

4. **Click the button**:
   - Watch console for click events
   - Count increments in signal (visible in logs)
   - UI doesn't update yet (expected)

5. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Page loads without errors
   - ✅ Button appears and is clickable
   - ✅ Console shows click events
   - ✅ Count increments correctly
   - ❌ UI doesn't update (known limitation)
