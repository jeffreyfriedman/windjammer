## Expected Behavior

### Reactive Examples (Counter, Button Test)
1. **Initial Load**: UI displays with initial state
2. **User Interaction**: Click button
3. **State Update**: Signal value changes
4. **Automatic Re-render**: UI updates immediately
5. **Visual Feedback**: New value displayed on screen

### Static Examples (Static Editor)
1. **Initial Load**: UI displays with all panels
2. **Layout**: Professional multi-panel layout
3. **Styling**: VS Code-inspired dark theme
4. **Components**: All components render correctly

### Desktop Editor
1. **Launch**: Application window opens
2. **UI**: All panels and controls visible
3. **Interactions**: Buttons respond to clicks
4. **File Operations**: Can read/write files
5. **Project Management**: Can create/manage projects
6. **Console**: Shows output and errors

## Known Working Features

### ✅ Reactive System
- `Signal<T>` with `get()`, `set()`, `update()`
- Automatic re-rendering on state changes
- `trigger_rerender()` called by signals
- `ReactiveApp` runtime

### ✅ Component System
- 14 UI components available
- `ToVNode` trait for composition
- Type-safe API
- Flexible nesting

### ✅ Event Handling
- Button click events
- Input change events
- Event handlers with closures
- State updates from events

### ✅ WASM Compilation
- Windjammer → Rust → WASM pipeline
- `wasm-bindgen` integration
- Browser compatibility
- Fast loading

### ✅ Desktop Integration
- Tauri commands
- File system access
- Native window management
- Cross-platform support

### ✅ Styling
- CSS framework
- VS Code-inspired theme
- Responsive layouts
- Professional appearance

## Troubleshooting

### If Server Isn't Running
```bash
cd /Users/jeffreyfriedman/src/windjammer/crates/windjammer-ui
../../target/release/serve_wasm
```

### If Examples Don't Load
1. Check server is running: `lsof -i:8080`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify WASM files exist in `pkg_*` directories
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### If Desktop Editor Won't Launch
```bash
cd /Users/jeffreyfriedman/src/windjammer
cargo build -p windjammer-game-editor
cargo run -p windjammer-game-editor
```

### If Styling Is Missing
1. Verify `components.css` exists in `crates/windjammer-ui/examples/`
2. Check server logs for 404 errors
3. Verify CSS link in HTML files

## Performance Notes

### Current Implementation
- **Full Re-render**: UI re-renders completely on each state change
- **No VDOM Diffing**: Not yet implemented (future optimization)
- **Acceptable Performance**: Fast enough for current examples
- **Memory Efficient**: Rust's ownership system prevents leaks

### Expected Performance
- **Small UIs** (< 10 components): Instant updates
- **Medium UIs** (10-50 components): Very fast updates
- **Large UIs** (50+ components): Acceptable updates

### Future Optimizations
- Implement Virtual DOM diffing
- Add memoization for computed values
- Optimize Signal notification system
- Implement lazy rendering

## Success Metrics

### ✅ All Examples Work
- Counter increments/decrements correctly
- Button test counts clicks
- Static editor displays properly
- Reactive editor renders correctly
- Desktop editor launches successfully

### ✅ No Console Errors
- WASM loads without errors
- JavaScript executes cleanly
- No 404s for resources
- No CORS issues

### ✅ Professional Appearance
- Styling is consistent
- Layout is responsive
- Theme is cohesive
- UI is polished

### ✅ Framework Validated
- Reactive system works
- Components compose properly
- Events fire correctly
- State updates trigger re-renders
- WASM compilation succeeds
- Desktop integration works

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Test all examples in browser
2. ✅ Launch desktop editor
3. ✅ Verify all functionality
4. ✅ Check for console errors

### Short Term
- Implement VDOM diffing for performance
- Add form validation components
- Create data fetching examples
- Build routing system

### Long Term
- Mobile app support
- Animation system
- More complex examples
- Performance benchmarks
- Production deployment guide
