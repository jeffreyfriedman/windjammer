# Windjammer v0.19.0: Language Server Protocol Implementation Plan

**Goal**: Build a world-class language server with real-time ownership inference hints and full editor support.

**Status**: In Progress  
**Target**: VSCode, Vim/Neovim, IntelliJ IDEA  
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Create the most delightful developer experience for a systems programming language by:
1. **Real-time feedback** - See errors and type info as you type
2. **Ownership visibility** - Show inferred `&`, `&mut` inline (unique!)
3. **Universal support** - Works in all major editors
4. **Full IDE features** - Refactoring, debugging, everything

## ðŸŽ¨ Unique Features (Differentiators)

### 1. Real-time Ownership Inference Hints âœ¨

**The Big Idea**: Show compiler's ownership decisions inline

```windjammer
// User sees this in their editor:
fn process_user(user: User /* inferred: & */) {
    println!("{}", user.name)
}

fn update_user(user: User /* inferred: &mut */) {
    user.name = "New Name"
}

fn take_user(user: User /* inferred: owned */) -> User {
    user
}
```

**Hover for explanation:**
```
Parameter `user` inferred as `&User`
Reason: Only reads, no writes or returns

Click to see full inference reasoning
[Override] [Learn More]
```

**Why This Matters**:
- No other language shows inference in real-time
- Teaches ownership while coding
- Transparent compiler decisions
- Unique selling point

### 2. Ownership Debugging Mode

```
fn complex_function(data: Vec<User>) {
    // Hover shows full ownership flow:
    // 1. `data` owned (parameter)
    // 2. Moved to `process_users()`
    // 3. Returned and moved to `result`
    let result = process_users(data)
    // data is no longer valid here
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Error Recovery

Show what the user *probably* meant:

```
Error: Cannot mutate immutable variable `count`
      |
   12 | count = count + 1
      | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutation of immutable variable
      |
Help: Did you mean to declare `count` as mutable?
   
   let mut count = 0  // Add `mut` here
   
[Quick Fix: Make mutable]
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Mapping Rust Errors to Windjammer

**Problem**: We transpile to Rust, so errors are in Rust terms

**Solution**: 
- Build comprehensive source map during transpilation
- Translate Rust error spans back to Windjammer
- Rewrite error messages in Windjammer terms
- Filter out Rust-specific suggestions

### Challenge 2: Incremental Compilation

**Problem**: Re-analyzing entire codebase on every keystroke is slow

**Solution**:
- Use Salsa for query-based incremental compilation
- Cache parsed ASTs per file
- Invalidate only affected files
- Lazy evaluation of dependencies

### Challenge 3: Cross-file Analysis

**Problem**: Need global view for references, renames, etc.

**Solution**:
- Build module dependency graph
- Index all symbols in workspace
- Use parallel processing for analysis
- Cache symbol tables

### Challenge 4: Ownership Inference in LSP

**Problem**: Inference happens during analysis, need to expose results

**Solution**:
- Store inference decisions in analysis results
- Expose via Salsa queries
- Generate inlay hints from inference data
- Provide detailed reasoning on demand
