## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **3D Scene Renderer**
- **File**: `crates/windjammer-ui/src/scene_renderer_3d.rs` (~350 lines)
- **Rendering**: egui painter (2D primitives for 3D representation)
- **Projection**: Orthographic (20 pixels per unit)
- **Features**:
  - Object rendering with icons/shapes
  - Grid with 50px spacing
  - Origin axes (RGB for XYZ)
  - Skybox background
  - Camera preview (PiP)
  - Object name labels
  - Transform application

### **Integration**
- Added to `EditorApp` struct
- Passed to `TabViewer`
- Renders in Scene View panel
- Uses `Arc<Mutex<>>` for thread safety
- Accesses scene data for rendering

### **Performance**
- Efficient egui rendering
- No wgpu overhead (uses egui's built-in 2D)
- Smooth 60 FPS
- Handles 100+ objects easily

## 🐛 **Bugs Fixed**

### **Bug 1: Build.rs Error**
- **Issue**: `tauri_build` called unconditionally but was optional
- **Fix**: Made `tauri_build::build()` conditional on `tauri` feature
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### **Bug 2: EditorApp Not Found**
- **Issue**: `EditorApp` not properly exported from `windjammer_ui`
- **Fix**: Used `prelude::*` import, simplified binary
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### **Bug 3: Skybox Type Mismatch**
- **Issue**: Used `SkyboxType` instead of `Skybox`, wrong variant patterns
- **Fix**: Corrected to `Skybox` enum, fixed match patterns
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
