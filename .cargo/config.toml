# Windows-specific configuration to increase stack size
# NOTE: build.rs dynamically sets stack size based on profile:
#   - Debug/Test: 16MB (no optimization, deeper call stacks)
#   - Release: 8MB (optimizations reduce stack usage)
# These settings are fallback in case build.rs doesn't run
# This prevents stack overflow during cleanup/Drop of deep AST structures
