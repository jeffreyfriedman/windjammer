## 🚧 Still TODO (Before Merge)

### Branch Objectives (Your Requirements)

1. ❌ **More tests**
   - Currently: 9 integration tests
   - Need: Unit tests for lexer, parser, analyzer
   - Need: Edge case tests
   - Need: Error message tests

2. ⚠️ **Test and fix examples**
   - ✅ hello_world - Works!
   - ❌ cli_tool - Needs character literal support
   - ❌ http_server - Parse error (needs debugging)
   - ❌ wasm_game - Parse error (needs debugging)
   - **Current**: 1/4 working (25%)
   - **Goal**: 4/4 working (100%)

3. ❌ **More examples**
   - Current: 4 examples (only 1 works)
   - Need: 5+ simple, working examples
   - Suggestions:
     - String manipulation
     - File I/O (read/write)
     - Vec/HashMap usage
     - Simple HTTP request
     - Channel communication
     - Concurrent processing

---

## 🎯 What Needs to Happen Next

### Priority 1: Fix Character Literals (Unblocks cli_tool)
```rust
// Add to lexer.rs
Token::CharLiteral(char)

// Add to parser.rs
Type::Char
Expression::Literal(Literal::Char(c))
```

**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Impact**: Unlocks cli_tool example

### Priority 2: Debug Existing Examples
- Add better error messages (line numbers!)
- Create minimal reproductions of parse errors
- Fix http_server and wasm_game parsing

**Effort**: 2-4 hours  
**Impact**: 4/4 examples working

### Priority 3: Create Simple Examples
Create 5 working examples that showcase:
1. **string_demo.wj** - String interpolation, operations
2. **vec_demo.wj** - Collections, iteration
3. **file_io.wj** - Read/write files
4. **channels.wj** - Concurrent communication
5. **http_client.wj** - Make HTTP requests

**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: Show what Windjammer can actually do

### Priority 4: Add More Tests
- Lexer tests (token generation)
- Parser tests (AST construction)
- Analyzer tests (ownership inference)
- Error case tests

**Effort**: 3-4 hours  
**Impact**: Prevent regressions

## ⏱️ Estimated Time to Completion

**Remaining work**: ~8-12 hours

Breakdown:
- Character literals: 1-2 hours
- Fix examples: 2-4 hours
- Create simple examples: 2-3 hours
- Add unit tests: 3-4 hours
- Final cleanup: 1 hour

**Recommendation**: Split into smaller PRs?

## 💡 Alternative Approach

### Option A: Merge What We Have (Quick)
**Pros**:
- Assignment statements are huge win
- 9/9 tests passing
- Clean commit history

**Cons**:
- Examples still broken
- Incomplete objective completion
- More work needed in next PR

### Option B: Complete All Objectives (Thorough)
**Pros**:
- All examples working
- Comprehensive test suite
- True "feature complete" PR

**Cons**:
- 8-12 more hours of work
- Large PR to review
- Risk of scope creep

### Option C: Split Into Multiple PRs (Recommended)
**PR #1** (This branch):
- Assignment statements ✅
- Documentation updates ✅
- Versioning strategy ✅
- **Merge now**, tag as v0.2.0

**PR #2** (Next):
- Character literal support
- Fix existing examples
- Add line numbers to errors

**PR #3** (After that):
- Create 5+ simple examples
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Tag as v0.3.0

**Pros**:
- Smaller, reviewable PRs
- Incremental progress
- Easier to test and validate

**Cons**:
- More PRs to manage
- Longer total timeline

## 🤔 Recommendation

I recommend **Option C** - split into multiple PRs:

**This PR** should include:
- ✅ Assignment statements
- ✅ 9/9 tests passing
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Versioning strategy
- ➕ Quick character literal fix (1-2 hours)
- ➕ CHANGELOG.md update
- ➕ Version bump to 0.2.0

**Effort**: 1-2 more hours  
**Result**: Clean, valuable PR ready to merge

**Next PR(s)** can tackle:
- Fixing remaining examples
- Creating simple examples
- Adding comprehensive tests
