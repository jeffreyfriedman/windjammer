// Test: Import resolution for types defined in other modules
// This tests that when we import a type from a module, the compiler
// correctly resolves which module file that type is defined in.

// Simulates the structure:
// - rigidbody2d.wj defines both RigidBody2D and Collider2D
// - collision2d.wj imports both from rigidbody2d

// This file simulates rigidbody2d.wj
pub struct RigidBody2D {
    pub position: f32,
    pub collider: Collider2D,
}

pub enum Collider2D {
    Box { width: f32, height: f32 },
    Circle { radius: f32 },
}
