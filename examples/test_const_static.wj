// Test Phase 7: Const/Static Optimization
//
// static declarations with compile-time values should become const

// Should become `const` (literal value)
static MAX_SIZE: int = 1024

// Should become `const` (const expression)
static BUFFER_SIZE: int = MAX_SIZE * 2

// Should become `const` (binary operation on literals)
static TIMEOUT_MS: int = 30 * 1000

// Should remain `static` (runtime computation would be needed in real case,
// but for literals it's still const-evaluable)
static PI_TIMES_TWO: float = 3.14159 * 2.0

fn main() {
    println("MAX_SIZE = {}", MAX_SIZE)
    println("BUFFER_SIZE = {}", BUFFER_SIZE)
    println("TIMEOUT_MS = {}", TIMEOUT_MS)
    println("PI_TIMES_TWO = {}", PI_TIMES_TWO)
